# Javascript-Password-Generator
This Repo is the Javascript Homework Challenge 
 
### In this challenge we were given starter code.
### Given that both the Html and Css are both done, our focus is on the Javascript portion of the Webpage


## User story
### I WANT to create funtions within Javascript that will generate a Random strong/secure password that meets all criteria


## Acceptance Criteria
### Create the functions needed in order to generate a secure password:

 #### When I observed the code I noticed that it was missing functions, I would click the red button and would receive no response.So I went into the javascript and created a function "generatePassword" and logged it .

### WHEN I click the button to generate a password Then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria:

#### I was a little confused on how to do this, and so I created a password myself and logged it in.

### WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password:

#### I gave my password 3 special characters, 3 numerical characters and 2 uppercase characters.

### WHEN prompted for the length of the password choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters:

#### I chose a password of 8 characters consisting of numbers,special characters, and uppercase letters.

### WHEN asked for character types to include in the password THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters WHEN I answer each prompt, my input should be validated, one or more character types should be selected:

#### I used 3 var character types to generate a password and logged it.

### WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria:

####

### WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page:
